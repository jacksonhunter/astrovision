# Debug & Diagnostic Scripts

Utility scripts for debugging FITS files, checking memory usage, and diagnosing processing issues.

## Scripts

- `check_fits_metadata.py` - Inspect FITS header information
- `check_memory.py` - Monitor memory usage during processing
- `debug_background2d.py` - Debug background subtraction issues
- `debug_hybrid.py` - Debug hybrid processing pipeline
- `diagnose_all_bands.py` - Analyze all bands in a FITS file
- `diagnose_background.py` - Diagnose background estimation problems
- `list_raw_fits.py` - List all FITS files in a directory

These are ad-hoc scripts created during development to troubleshoot specific issues.
